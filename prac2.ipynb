The work of an agent is to ﬁnd out how to act, now and in the future, so that it reaches a goal state. In this way, we need to decide on its behalf or it needs to decide what sorts of actions and states it should consider. The problem formulation is the process of deciding what actions and states to consider, given a goal. Becaues at that level of detail, there is too much uncertainty in the world and there would be too many steps in a solution, it is very necessary for us to do the problem formulation before we write the problem formulation. Determining our problem goals is a part of problem formulation, and it helps us to set a limit or standard to decide whether a kind of information about our problems is detailed and ignorable, which is very important in the process of problem formulation.\n",
